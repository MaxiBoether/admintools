# This script takes an email from stdin and delivers it to
# the addresses provided as command line arguments.
# It forces the "To:" header to be set.

# Why?
# When using /etc/aliases to redirect local mail to an mailing list for
# example, some mailing list servers will complaint about the unset "To:"
# header (Mailman will mumble something about an implicit destination).
# You normally don't want to configure every single local sender
# (apticron, rkhunter, web apps, â€¦) to send to a specific address since
# it is inflexible and sometimes even not possible.
