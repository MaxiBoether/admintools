A structure that allows to specify any number of executable files per hook.

It does so by calling all executable files, who's name start with the
name of the hook and do not end with `.sample`.

E.g., when the "pre-push" hook is triggered, the hypothetical executable
file `pre-push-setup-vpn` would be called, whereas `pre-push-template.sample`
would not.
